# controlFlow-1

When confronting iterations, how do you store information without rewriting it? For that matter, how and when is information rewritten?

Control flow is how data is stored, used, and returned in loops. Bad control flow may execute a return too early or redefine variables to something we don't want.

In this problem series, we will go over both debugging conrol flow and writing control flow.
